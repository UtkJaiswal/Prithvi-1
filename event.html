                                    Cannot fathom what to do with your wandering brain during the night?<br>
                                    Grid-nite offers you a challenging as well as a fun experience to keep yourself
                                    occupied. It's an over night event where participants will be given the grid the
                                    evening before and the answers will be collected the following morning. It involves

                                    Participants will be provided with a grid which will carry words related to Earth

                                    Here's a twist - The competition isn't about finding the maximum number of words
                                    from the grid, it's about creating as many geologically meaningful sentences using

                                    For Poster presentation, you can choose ANY topic related to Geoscience. <br>
                                    In the past, we had submissions from participants on varied topics ranging from
                                    unconventional hydrocarbons, plate tectonics, structural, stratigraphical and
                                    geo-chemical modelling to seismic analysis, near surface geophysics etc. Note that
                                    above topics are for giving example only. You are free to choose any topic but it
